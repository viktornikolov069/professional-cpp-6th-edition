# Learning C++ with *Professional C++ (6th Edition)*

This repository documents my journey through **Professional C++ (6th Edition)** by Marc Gregoire.  
It contains:
- **Code examples & exercises**: My implementations while working through the book.
- **Notes (`notes.md`)**: Key takeaways, summaries, and personal insights.

---

## 📚 About the Project
This repo is primarily for **learning and practice**.  
I’m experimenting with modern C++ features, design patterns, and best practices as presented in the book.  

Feel free to:
- Browse the code and notes.
- Clone the repo and try the exercises yourself.
- Suggest improvements or alternative solutions.

## ⚙️ Building & Running
Most examples can be compiled with a C++20 (or later) compiler.  

Example using `g++`:
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -o example examples/example.cpp
./example
```

Or, if using CMake:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
